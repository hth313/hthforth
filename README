hthforth is a Forth-2012 written in Haskell and Forth. The idea is to
keep pace with the development of the proposed Forth 200x standard
(currently called Forth-2012).
Visit http://www.forth200x.org for more information.

This Forth can be used standalone, just build it using Haskell
cabal. Another use would be as an embedded scripting language in
a Haskell application.
However, the main idea is to make it act as a cross compiler for
embedded systems development.

Current status is that all core words are in place for the interpreter.
The next step will be to implement a cross compiler.

Forth works differently from many other languages in that it basically
lacks syntax and is not suitable to parse using normal parsing techniques.
Instead, one have to build a Forth system from another Forth which acts as
a bootstrapper, a technique that is called meta compiling in the Forth
world. This Forth is meant to be such meta compiler, or perhaps more
correctly, a cross compiler, as the intended target will be different.

To build hthforth, you will need to have Haskell installed. The
current version of GHC used is 7.8.3.

With a suitable GHC, do the following in the top level directory:
% cabal configure
% cabal build

This may fail with vector-bytestring as the version on Hackage has
not been updated for GHC 7.8. If this happens, you need to download
a working copy from https://github.com/basvandijk/vector-bytestring
and edit it to accept base 4.7. Another alternative is to copy the
one I have modified (https://github.com/hth313/vector-bytestring).
Just clone it, step into the directory and 'cabal install' it.
Then go back and build hthforth again.

To run hthforth:
% dist/build/hthforth/hthforth

When started, there is a very small subset of core words available. To
bring more words in:
LOAD-SOURCE src/lib/core.fs

To exit hthforth, type BYE or press Ctrl-C.

Haskeline is used, so you have full command line history and editing
available.

There is also a Trello board for this project available at
https://trello.com/b/HNLHA3en/hthforth which is currently
not kept so well updated. Most project planning and ideas
take place in the TODO.org (which is not always up to date in
the repository), a file to be opened with Emacs org mode.
