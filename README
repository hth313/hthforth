ppforth is a Forth-2012 written in Haskell and Forth. The ideas is to
keep pace with the development of ANS EuroForth standard.

The current aim is to have fun implementing Forth, provide a subset of
the standard by implementing core words.

This Forth can be used standalone, just build it using Haskell
cabal. Later it is hoped it can be used as an embedded scripting
language in Haskell.
Further down the road the idea is also to make it into Forth cross
compiler for embedded systems development.
