hthforth is a Forth-2012 written in Haskell and Forth. The idea is to
keep pace with the development of the proposed Forth 200x standard
(currently called Forth-2012).
Visit http://www.forth200x.org for more information.

This project is under development and is currently not complete in any
way.

At the moment the aim is to have fun implementing Forth and provide a
subset of the standard by implementing the core set of words, probably
including core-ext words as well.

This Forth can be used standalone, just build it using Haskell
cabal. Later it is hoped it can also be used as an embedded scripting
language in Haskell.
Even further down the road the idea is to also make it into Forth
cross compiler for embedded systems development.

To build hthforth, you will need to have Haskell installed. The
current version of GHC used is 7.8.2.

With a suitable GHC, do the following in the top level directory:
% cabal configure
% cabal build

To run:
% dist/build/hthforth/hthforth

When started, there is a very small subset of core words available. To
bring more words in (it will currently fail a bit into the file):
LOAD-SOURCE src/lib/core.fs

To exit hthforth, type BYE or press Ctrl-C.

Haskeline is used, so you have full command line history and editing
available.
