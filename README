hthforth is a Forth-2012 written in Haskell and Forth. The idea is to
keep pace with the development of the proposed Forth 200x standard
(currently called Forth-2012).
Visit http://www.forth200x.org for more information.

This Forth can be used standalone, just build it using Haskell
cabal. Another use would be as an embedded scripting language in
a Haskell application.
However, the main idea is to make it act as a cross compiler for
embedded systems development.

Current status is that all core words are in place for the interpreter.
The next step will be to implement a cross compiler.
(Prototyping with a CortexM target has started).

Forth works differently from many other languages in that it basically
lacks syntax and is not suitable to parse using normal parsing techniques.
Instead, one have to build a Forth system from another Forth which acts as
a bootstrapper, a technique that is called meta compiling in the Forth
world. This Forth is meant to be such meta compiler, or perhaps more
correctly, a cross compiler, as the intended target will be different.

To build hthforth, you will need to have Haskell installed. The
current version of GHC used is 7.8.3, but 7.6.3 should also work well.

With a suitable GHC, do the following in the top level directory:
% cabal configure
% cabal build

To run hthforth:
% dist/build/hthforth/hthforth

When started, there is a very small subset of core words available. To
bring more words in:
LOAD-SOURCE src/lib/core.fs

To exit hthforth, type BYE or press Ctrl-C.

Haskeline is used, so you have full command line history and editing
available.

There is also a Trello board for this project available at
https://trello.com/b/HNLHA3en/hthforth which is currently
not kept so well updated. Most project planning and ideas
take place in the TODO.org (which is not always up to date in
the repository), a file to be opened with Emacs org mode.
